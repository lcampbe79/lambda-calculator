**STEP 1**

- [ ] Import the data into the necessary files, but do not change the data.

- [ ] Data should be imported into the wrapper components: 
   - [ ] Numbers
   - [ ] Operators
   - [ ] Specials

*Step 2**

- [X] Add the data to state like this:
  - [ ]```js
      import { numbers } from '../path/to/data';

  - [ ] const [numberState, setNumberState] = useState(numbers);

**Step 3**

 - [ ] Map over the data and dynamically render components for each piece of data in the arrays.


 - [ ] You will need to import the component that you'll render in the map function.

**STEP 4**

- [ ] Import the wrapper button components into `App.js`

- [ ] Import the display components into `App.js` as well

- [ ] Compose all the components inside the `App` component to get your calculator rendering on the DOM

- [ ] In each component, start designing things to match the design file

- [ ] Style your project using any of the techniques from the module

- [ ] Don't forget about className vs class on your JSX elements!!
